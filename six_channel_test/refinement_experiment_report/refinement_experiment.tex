\section{Introduction}
In this document, I will record the experiment procedure of refining the six channel single shot multispectral reconstruction.
\section{Reconstruction of simulation}
The results from simulated snapshots show significant color shift due to false first channel reconstruction. The reconstruction is built on simulated ring PSFs. The PSFs is $21\times 21$ and the ring width is one pixel. One hypothesis of the source of error is that the over-simplified rings would mislead the algorithm. Another hypothesis is that the existance of central peak, which appears in the imaging setup, benefits the restoration of sharp images. In this experiment, I would like to test the source of error. 
\subsection{Experiment procedure}
\subsubsection{Ring PSFs wider than single pixel}
\begin{itemize}
\item Design ring PSFs of larger dimension, for example $81\times 81$, both single pixel and wider
\item Pad image edges
\item Reconstruct results from single pixel ring PSFs
\item Reconstruct results from wider ring PSFs 
\item Compare
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Ring PSFs with central peak}
\begin{itemize}
\item Design ring PSFs with central peak
\item Reconstruct results from PSFs with central peaks
\item Reconstruct results from PSFs without central peaks (if data lost)
\end{itemize}
